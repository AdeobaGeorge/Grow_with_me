#AI assisted chatbot/helper
#You need your own weather and openai api key. learned a lot this project, especially with figuring out what services to use when working with more than just the traditional
#import os and tkinter. I had made an AI assistant before, using  gpt 2 from the hugging face library. I decided it was best to have someone put their own api key to the code for 
#reusability. The code could definitely be streamlined more. I intend to keep working and expanding on this.
